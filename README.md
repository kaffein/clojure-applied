# clojure-applied

This repository revisits the source code and concepts seen in the "Clojure Applied" book by Alex Miller and Ben Vandergrift.

Rephrasing greatly helps in understanding the material since it allows you to get your own mental representation/model of the concept covered by the example or use-case.
